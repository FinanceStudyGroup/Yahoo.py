To run this program, be sure to get [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/), and the most recent releases of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBF&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1005992%20%7C%20Chrome%20Win10%20%7C%20DR%20%7C%20ESS01%20%7C%20NA%20%7C%20US%20%7C%20en%20%7C%20Desk%20%7C%20BING%20SEM%20%7C%20BKWS%20~%20Top%20KWDS%20-%20Exact&utm_term=google%20chrome&utm_content=Google%20Chrome%20-%20Exact&ds_kid=43700010220923516&gclid=CNupzfPj--ACFduGxQIdWPcHaA&gclsrc=ds),
and [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.46/).

The Selenium package for Python allows for automation of an instance of the web browser.

Specifically, we can write Python code to use the Selenium package to run Chrome Driver and control Google Chrome.

In this way, we can automate key research workflows, quickening the due diligence process.

From the command line, we might simply run,

```
python Yahoo.py
```
after which, we will be prompted for a ticker symbol -- and as an example we might run,

Ticker:
```
JNJ
```
where under this research parameter, we'll quickly be directed to the Yahoo Finance business
description profile for our chosen stock.
